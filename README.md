## Intro
- The photographer always seeking for an opportunity to showcase their work and get a client who can pay for their skills. We are providing a platform where the photographer can upload their best photos on the website and another user can view their profile. 
- This platform is also for a normal user who is looking for a photographer for a specific event like a wedding, social event, professional photographer or fashion blogging. Customer/user can find photographer by location and by categories on this website. As per review, availability or chrages of the photographer, user can hire a photographer. Once user hires a photographer and completes the payment process, user and photographer both will receive a mail notification.

## Design Choices
The draw to our application revolves around how simple our tool is to use. Therefore, we wanted our design to reflect these goals. We wanted all of our forms
to be quite simple, and to minimize inputs. We also thought it would be logical to work towards having a minimalistic design - not including any excess details.
We're using pastel-based colours on our website as we thought that it adds the impression that our website is warm, welcoming, and easy to use.

## REOURCES USED:
- Bootstrap 
- Most styling was modified, but utilized general look and feeling for most components. 
- The bootstrap grid system is also super useful and used throughout the site.
