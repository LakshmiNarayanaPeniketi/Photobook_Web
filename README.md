Project Details

The photographer always seeking for an opportunity to showcase their work and get a client who can pay for their skills. We are providing a platform where the photographer can upload their best photos on the website and another user can view their profile. This platform is also for a normal user who is looking for a photographer for a specific event like a wedding, social event, professional photographer or fashion blogging. Customer/user can find photographer by location and by categories on this website. As per review, availability or chrages of the photographer, user can hire a photographer. Once user hires a photographer and completes the payment process, user and photographer both will receive a mail notification.

Design Choices
The draw to our application revolves around how simple our tool is to use. Therefore, we wanted our design to reflect these goals. We wanted all of our forms
to be quite simple, and to minimize inputs. We also thought it would be logical to work towards having a minimalistic design - not including any excess details.
We're using pastel-based colours on our website as we thought that it adds the impression that our website is warm, welcoming, and easy to use.
REOURCES USED:
Bootstrap - Most styling was modified, but utilized general look and feeling for most components. The bootstrap grid
system is also super useful and used throughout the site.

README File - Photobook A4 - Luke Andrews B00738530

Git repository: https://git.cs.dal.ca/kacha/a4_web
Branch: loginBackend

Currently encountering issues hosting my assignment

Feature: Login

This involves implementing the functionality for the login form. When a user goes to login it should check the database
to see if the credentials match an existing user. 

It will also make it so a user cannot access pages that are gated behind being logged in but this isn't ready to be
implemented until we have integrated each of our features together. Therefore, it will be added for the demo and only
the "frameworks" of this will be set up for now.

Files worked on were front end validated. Were lots of warnings pertaining to Angular syntax, but I didn't catch
any "legitamate" errors.

To view mongodb:
Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
user - mohit@dal.ca
password - Mongo56@db

Instructions:
-Arrive at the index page
-Click the sign up button in the header
-Register for an account with valid credentials
-Click the login button to be redirected to the login page
-Login to the account
-Redirect to the dashboard page


--Folder Structure--

Angular projects have a separate folder structure as compared to what was described. The application is divided
into components where each component has it's own file for CSS, HTML, and Typescript. All images/videos necessary
are stored together in the assets folder.

--Code References--

-Angular based project
-Node.js + Express
-Bootstrap was used as a front-end framework throughout the project
-https://angular.io/tutorial was used when initially building the app
-Utilized some backend code off of Mohit's branch. He was working on implementing the signup feature
which is in-line with what I'm working on (Login). Also used the same database connection file in order
to avoid merge conflicts and for ease of set up.
